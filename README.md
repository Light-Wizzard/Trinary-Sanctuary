# Trinary Sanctuary

Trinary Sanctuary is the design of a complete society including software, hardware, and CAD.

The software will be written in Qt.

Currently, I am working on the CAD drawings in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)

I have tried to use Blender, but it does not seem to handle the real size of the architecture, which is in the Miles. 

The Pyramid in the center is Trinary Sanctuary, which can be any size, I will design an optimal-size complex, so this pyramid is 66,666 feet wide and tall.

Rings separate the complex into sections, we have the Military Ring, Oasis Ring, and Outlanders Ring.
