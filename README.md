# Trinary Sanctuary

Trinary Sanctuary is the design of a complete society including software, hardware, and CAD.

I wrote a book that explains the reason for Trianry Sanctuary, it is called [The Principles Of-The Trinary Universe](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/The-Principles-Of-The-Trinary-Universe/blob/master/misc/the.principles.of.the.trinary.universe.pdf)

The software will be written in Qt.

Currently, I am working on the CAD drawings in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)

I have tried to use Blender, but it does not handle the real size of the architecture in the Miles, and trying to scale things got confusing when I needed to find the size of an object. I decided to use FreeCAD, and then import them into Blender, where I can scale them. 

The Pyramid in the center is Trinary Sanctuary, which can be any size, I will design an optimal-size complex, so this pyramid is 66,666 feet wide and tall.

Rings separate the complex into sections, we have the Military Ring, Oasis Ring, and Outlanders Ring.

I am working on a book called "Light Beings", and when it came time to talk about the size of the complex, I was at a loss. 

By the time you get out to the Outlander Ring, the complex can grow to 666 miles in diameter.
