# Trinary Sanctuary

Trinary Sanctuary is the design of a complete society including software, hardware, and CAD.

The software will be written in Qt.

Currently, I am working on the CAD drawings in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)

I have tried to use Blender, but it does not seem to handle the real size of the architecture, which is in the Miles.
